## Instructions to run the App
To run a Kotlin JVM app, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the JDK
The JDK is required to compile and run Kotlin code. Make sure you have installed version 17 or another stable version on your machine. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the official Oracle website.

### 2. Install an IDE that supports Kotlin and Java
Although you can use any code editor to write Kotlin code, an IDE is highly recommended for a better development experience. We suggest using IntelliJ IDEA, which includes the necessary tools and runtime to support Kotlin and Java.

### 3. Install a dependency manager
If your project uses external libraries, you will need a dependency manager. Gradle is one of the most popular dependency managers for Kotlin and Java projects, but Maven is also a viable option.

### 4. Configure the environment
Make sure to properly configure the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables so that the operating system can find the JVM. The JAVA_HOME path should point to the folder where the JDK is installed.

### 5. Configure the environment and required plugins
GradleIpdater, JUnitGenerator V2.0, Maven Helper.

### 6. Run the app
Once all the previous steps have been completed successfully, you should be ready to run the app. Open the project in your IDE and run it. The IDE should automatically compile the Kotlin code and run the app. If there are any issues, check the logs or refer to the project documentation for help.
